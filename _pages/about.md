I am a graduated master - degree student from [College of Sciences Northeastern University](http://cos.neu.edu.cn).

My research interest include data mining, machine learning, and the numerical solution of differential equations.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Zhang Tie](http://cos.neu.edu.cn/2019/0318/c3821a84535/pagem.htm), Northeastern University.
